/**
 * This annotation should be used on methods that need to be notified when the cache is called to participate in a
 * transaction and the transaction completes, either with a commit or a rollback.
 * <p/>
 * Methods annotated with this annotation should accept a single parameter, a {@link
 * org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.event.TransactionCompletedEvent} otherwise a {@link
 * org.infinispan.notifications.IncorrectListenerException} will be thrown when registering your listener.
 * <p/>
 * Note that methods marked with this annotation will only be fired <i>after the fact</i>, i.e., your method will never
 * be called with {@link org.infinispan.notifications.cachelistener.event.Event#isPre()} being set to <tt>true</tt>.
